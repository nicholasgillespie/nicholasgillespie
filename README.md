Hi! I'm Nicholas Gillespie, a former Royal Marines Commando turned web developer. My interest in web development began in 2014 while building websites with WordPress for personal projects.

Fast-forward to today, I have gained a proficient skill set in both front-end and back-end technologies with a specialization in JavaScript & CSS. My main focus these days is on developing fully responsive digital applications and experiences that are accessible and inclusive to all website users.

Some of the key components of my tech stack include:

| Back-end          | Front-end          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | HTML5              |
| Node.js           | CSS3               |
| Express           | CUBE CSS           |
| MongoDB           | Fluid type & Space |
| RESTful API       | Flexible Layouts   |
